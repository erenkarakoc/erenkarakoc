# Hi, I'm Eren.

## A Full-Stack web/mobile developer.

I have been actively working as a full-stack developer in the software industry for 6 years. I also have experience in UI & UX design. I continuously strive to improve myself in web and mobile software technologies and keep up with industry trends. In most projects, I take part as a Next.js/React/React Native developer. My priorities are writing clean and understandable code, creating pixel-perfect interfaces aligned with user experience, and developing scalable and high-performance software.
